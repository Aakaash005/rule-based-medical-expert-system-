# Rule-Based Expert System

## Overview
This project is a rule-based medical expert system developed using recognized
Artificial Intelligence techniques such as **forward chaining** and
**if-then rules**.

## Features
- Accepts user symptoms as facts
- Applies multi-step inference using forward chaining
- Logs inference steps for transparency
- Clean and interactive UI using Streamlit

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Symbolic AI (Expert System)

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.9+
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Example
Input: fever, cough, body_pain  
Output: viral infection

## Future Scope
- Dynamic rule creation
- Confidence scores
- Database-backed knowledge base
